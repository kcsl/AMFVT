## Overview
The Android Malicious Flow Visualization Toolbox empowers a human analyst to detect sophisticated zero-day malware. The toolbox incorporates visualization capabilities that help understand and analyze complex Android semantics used by an app. 

## Visualization Capabilities
The Android Malicious Flow Visualization Toolbox (AMFVT) project supports the following interactive visualization capabilities.

- Android Subsystem Interaction Smart View: Visualize interactions of the app with various sub-systems of Android via data and control flow
- Exceptional Flow Smart View: Visualize howexceptions thrown and caught by the app may amount to maliciousbehavior by the agency of Javaâ€™s exception flow semantics
- Integrity Checker Smart View: Visualize how sensitive data may be modified by the app leading toan integrity breach

## Features
Interactive features supported by the visualization capabilities include:

- Source correspondence
- Automatic recomputation on change of selection: an analyst can click to select a specific code artifact, and the smart view is automatically recomputed and displayed corresponding to the new selection
- Analyst can select code artifacts from the source as well as elements of the graphs produced by a smart view
- Smart views are composable: selecting a code artifact from the output of one smart view can be used as input to another smart view
