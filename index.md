## Overview
The Android Malicious Flow Visualization Toolbox empowers a human analyst to detect sophisticated zero-day malware. The toolbox incorporates visualization capabilities that help understand and analyze complex Android semantics used by an app. 

## Visualization Capabilities
The Android Malicious Flow Visualization Toolbox (AMFVT) project supports the following interactive visualization capabilities.

1. Android Subsystem Interaction Smart View: Visualize interactions of the app with various sub-systems of Android via data and control flow
2. Exceptional Flow Smart View: Visualize how exceptions thrown and caught by the app may amount to malicious behavior by the agency of Javaâ€™s exception flow semantics
3. Integrity Checker Smart View: Visualize how sensitive data may be modified by the app leading toan integrity breach

## Features
Interactive features supported by the visualization capabilities include:

1. Source correspondence: an analyst can click on a graph element from a smart view result to go to the corresponding source code location, and vice versa
2. Automatic recomputation on change of selection: an analyst can click to select a specific code artifact, and the smart view is automatically recomputed and displayed corresponding to the new selection
3. Smart views are composable: selecting a code artifact from the output of one smart view can be used as input to another smart view

<em>More visualization capabilities can be easily added to the toolbox. We are currently working to integrate an Intent Resolution Smart View to visualize flows between apps via Intents.</em>
