If you haven't already, [install](/AMFVT/install) the AMFVT plugin into Eclipse.

## Install dependencies

If you plan to analyze an Android source application you will need the ability to compile an Android application in the Eclipse workspace. To do so you will need to install the Android ADT plugin. Google has discontinued support of Android development for Eclipse, but the eclipse update site is still active: `https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/`. Once installed you should use the SDK Manager to download the appropriate Android API versions for your analysis task. If you plan to audit an Android APK (compiled binary) then you do not need this dependency.
